    <div>I was close with computer science from my childhood.
      It was always curious to me how it work from hardware and operating system side.
      Today I build and modify my own PC and laptops.
      I started being interested about coding during my studies. Then my journey started and I begin to learn C++.
      Soon after finishing master studies I discovered offer with Java bootcamp.
      It was hard to get in as it was sponsored, but was I pass every test and was chosen.
      After finishing passing last exam and presenting final project I got job for 3 months in UK as Java developer.
      It was more like training.
